** Pointers

*** Variables vs Pointers

    - A memory address stores a variable with a specific data type.
    - A Pointer stores the memory address of a specific "variable".

    @code c

    int x = 5;
    int *ptr = x;

    printf("%d %d", x, *ptr); // Outputs -> "5 5"

    // Addresses can be assigned directly to pointers.

    ptr = &x // Stores the memory address of x directly

    @end

    - The variable `ptr` contains the memory address of the variable `x` while `*ptr` contains the value of `x`.
    - `*` â†’ value at <pointer>, Therefore `*ptr` returns the value stored at the memory address `ptr`.
    - Pointers have the format specifier of `%p`.
    - Pointers can point at other pointers

*** Pointer operations

**** Pointer addition\\subtraction

     Let a pointer of an int size `ptr` equal 1000.

     Adding to the pointer through `++ptr` the pointer will equal 1004
     since pointers are incremented and decremented by the size of
     their data type.
