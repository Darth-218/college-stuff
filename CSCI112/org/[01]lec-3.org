** Control structure

- Sequence 
- Selection 
- Repetetion

*** Selection

#+begin_quote

if (condition) then (action) else (action)

#+end_quote

**** single selection statment

#+begin_quote

if a condition is met perform an action, else the action is skipped.

#+end_quote

#+begin_src C

if (condition) {

  statment;
}

#+end_src

**** Double selection statment

#+begin_quote

if a condition is met perform an action, else perform another action.
 
#+end_quote

#+begin_src C

if (condition) {

  statment;
}

else {

  statment;
}

#+end_src

Another syntax

#+begin_src C

printf("%d", condition ? 0 : 1);

#+end_src

Print "0" if the condition is true and "1" if the condition is false.

**** Multiple selection statment 

#+begin_quote

if a condition is met perfrom an action, else if the second condition is met perform a second action and so on.

#+end_quote

***** Switch case

#+begin_quote

Takes an input and acts according to the value of the input.

#+end_quote

#+begin_src C

switch (value) {

  case val1:
    
    statment;
    break;

  case val2:
    
    statment;
    break;

  case val3:
    
    statment;
    break;

  default:

    statment;
    break;
}

#+end_src
