** Program tracing and debugging (cont.)

*** Code debugging

| Line | Memory (vars) | Input | Output |
| #1   | var1  |  var2 |       |        |
| #2   | dec   |  dec  |       |        |
| #3   |       |       | test  | test   |

*** Choosing variable names

To name a variable, keep in mind:

- Variable names are case sensitive.
- Variable names can contain letters digits and underscores.
  - Numbers can't be at the start of a variable name
- Keywords can't be used as variable names

*** Common C data types

- ~char~ : a single byte holding only one character.
- ~int~ : 4-8 bytes that can hold integers up to a certain value.
- ~float~ : floating point numbers.
- ~bool~ : (included in <stdbool.h>) holds 1 for true and 0 for false.
