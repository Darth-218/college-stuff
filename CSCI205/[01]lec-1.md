## Embedded systems

An embedded system is a compact programmable device 
intended to have a physical effect through taking physical
input and outputing a physical output.

### Arduino Uno

Contains 14 digital pins, 6 analog pins a USB port and an ISCP header.

#### Arduino commands and functions

1. `setup()`

    - Used to excute code at the start of the program that identifies pins.

```ino

void setup() {

    int <variable> = <pin number>;
    
}
```

2. `loop()`

    - Containts code that is excuted while the board is running.

```ino

void loop() {

    digitalWrite(<pin number>, <Value>) // Value can be LOW or HIGH.
}
```

3. `delay(<time>)`

    - Freezes the program for a specific period of time in ms.

```ino

delay(250);
```
