** Program tracing and debugging

A program to print "hello world".

#+BEGIN_SRC c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    printf("hello world");
    return 0;
}

#+END_SRC

*** Embedded systems

An embedded system is a compact programmable device 
intended to have a physical effect through taking physical
input and outputing a physical output.

**** Arduino Uno

Contains 14 digital pins, 6 analog pins a USB port and an ISCP header.

***** Arduino commands and functions

1. ~setup()~

    - Used to excute code at the start of the program usually to identify pins.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++

void setup() {

    int <variable> = <pin number>;

}

#+END_SRC

2. ~loop()~

    - Containts code that is excuted while the board is running.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++

void loop() {

    digitalWrite(<pin number>, <Value>) // Value can be LOW or HIGH.
}

#+END_SRC

3. ~delay(<time>)~

    - Freezes the program for a specific period of time in ms.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++

delay(250);

#+END_SRC
