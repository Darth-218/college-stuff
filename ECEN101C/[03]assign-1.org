* Assignment #1

** TODO Question 1

a)
   Voltage at 10ms

   $$15e^{-250 \times (10 \times 10^{-3})} = $$

   Current at 10ms

   $$40e^{-250 \times (10 \times 10^{-3})} = $$

   $\therefore$ The power supplied at 10ms

   $$P = V \times I = $$

b)
   Total energy supplied\delivered $$$$

   $$E = P \times t$$

** TODO Question 2

a)
   TODO

b)
   Energy delivered to the circuit at t = 10ms

   at t = 30ms

   at t = 80ms

** Question 3

$\because$ The sum of power absorbed and power delivered equals zero

$$P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{4} + P_{5} = -205 + 60 + 45 + 30 = -70 \rightarrow P_{3} = 70$$

** Question 4

$$P = 1.5kW, \qquad t = \frac{3.5}{60}$$

Energy per hour:
$$E = P \times t = 1.5\times \frac{3.5}{60} = 0.0875J$$

Energy per month:

$$E \times 30 = 0.0875 \times 30 = 2.625J$$

Cost per month:

$$E_{month} \times Cost_{hour} = 2.625 \times 8.2 = 21.525$$

$\therefore$ The cost of operating once a day for 30 days is 21.525 cents.
