# Volt calssification

- up to 1000V            > Low voltage
- between 1kV and 50kV   > Mideum voltage
- between 50kV and 500kV > High voltage

# Electric circuits

For the circuits to be a circuit it needs:
- A supply
- A load
    
    - Light
    - Heat
    - Mechanical energy aka a motor

- A wire
- A switch

# Basic circuit quantities

Most common types of wire are copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al).

1. The charge  (q > coulumb)

2. The current (I > ampere = C/S)
    
    The rate of change of the quantity of charges.
    
    I = dq/dt   > differentiation of the charge
    q = i(t).dt > integration of the current

    Example:
        
        - q = 12e-12t >> I = 12(-12)e-12t mA

3. The potential difference (V > volt = J/C)

    The energy affecting the charge to move it a certain distance.

    V = dW/dq

4. The electrical energy (W > joule)

5. The electrical power (P > watt = J/S)

    p = dW/dt = I * V = V * I = Ie2 * R = Ve2/R

1. DC circuits

    Constant voltage and current.

2. AC circuits

    Alternating voltage and current.

# Basic circuit elements

1. Passive elements

    Elements that absorb the electrical energy.

    - The most common passive elements:
        
        - The resistor        (R > ohm)    (DC & AC)
        - The electrical coil (L > henery) (AC only)
        - The capacitor       (C > farad)  (AC only)

2. Active elements

    Elements that generate the electrical energy.

    1. Current source

        Identified from the direction.

        - Independant

            Constant current intensity.

        - Dependant (Voltage controlled -Vx- || Current controlled -Iy-)

            Variable current intensity.

    2. Voltage source
        
        Identified from the polarity.

        - Independant

            Constant voltage
            
        - Dependant (Voltage controlled -Vy- || Current controlled -Io-) 

            Variable voltage

# Basic circuit laws

1. Ohm's law

    V = I * R

    - Power types (Conventional sign rule)

        Only applied when both the current and voltage are positive.

        1. Power absorbed

            Current enters the element from the positive side.

        2. Power supplied/delivered

            Current leaves the element from the positive side. 

        For any balanced circuit (with an ideal wire) the sum of the power consumed equals the sum of the supplied power

2. Kirchoff's law
